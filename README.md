# RTEmergencyChute
RemoteTech addon for deploying chutes safely on unresponsive craft

# How to use
Simply install the RTEmergencyChute folder into your Gamedata\ folder.
Requires RemoteTech to function.

Once installed, RTEmergencyChute will activate when a craft loses connection with KSC.
If a craft still has a connection with KSC, then you will need to manually deploy the parachute as usual.
